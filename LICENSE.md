Fire department calls data is created and maintained by the San Francisco Fire department (SFFD). The calls include all the response by fire units to calls. A few news articles suggest that SFFD has been having a few troubles with the dispatch system and organizing their ambulances. Analyzing these emergency calls, will give us a deep insight on how to improve man power and vehicular requirements to enable better service to the citizens. HiveQL and MapReduce programs have been used to query the data. After obtaining the results for the queries, data visualization was performed to observe patterns between the call volumes, the locations and timeline of these calls.
